About Project-
Built a plant disease detection system using transfer learning (ResNet50/MobileNetV2) to classify healthy and diseased leaves from images with ~95% accuracy.

Implemented end-to-end pipeline including image preprocessing, model training/evaluation (confusion matrix), and real-time inference on new leaf images.

Deployed the model as a web application using Flask/Streamlit for user-friendly disease prediction.
