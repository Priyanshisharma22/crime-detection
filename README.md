About Project-
Built a real-time CCTV Suspicious Activity Detection system to identify fighting, theft, and abnormal behavior using deep learning–based action recognition models.

Implemented I3D / SlowFast architectures with video preprocessing and temporal modeling to accurately classify human actions from surveillance footage.

Achieved reliable detection by integrating model inference with frame sampling and evaluation metrics, demonstrating end-to-end deployment readiness.
